    <h3>
      <b>Electricity</b> and <b>magnetism</b> are related forces.<br>
      Wires that carry a <i>current</i> create <b>magnetic fields</b>.<br>
      This <b>magnetic field</b> can be strengthened by coiling a wire into a <b>solenoid</b>.<br>
      It can be further strengthened by inserting a <b>metal core</b> into the <b>solenoid</b>, such as a nail.<br>
      Increasing the <i>current</i> of the wire will also strengthen the <b>magnetic field</b> accordingly.<br>
      <b>This structure is known as an <i>electromagnet</i>.</b><br>
      It is a <i>powerful tool</i> because it <b>behaves like a magnet when electrified, but otherwise, it has no magnetic properties.</b><br>
      This <u>lab</u> will help you learn all about <b>electromagnetism</b> and <i>how it works</i>.

      You will need:

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b> (9-inch) length of insulated copper wire</b><br>
            <i>(only use one 9-inch length unless you are testing wire length for your experiment; see below)</i>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>1 D-size battery</b>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Non-galvanized iron nail(s)</b><br>
            <i>(use more than one if multiple nails are necessary for your experiment; see below)</i>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>2 small erasers or other insulative material</b><br>
            <i>(to contain heat from the ends of the wire)</i>

        <li>

      <b>The Lab</b>
    </h1>
    <h3>
      You already know that increasing the current of the electromagnet (such as by adding a battery of higher voltage) will increase its strength.<br>
      <b>But what else will make an electromagnet stronger?</b><br>
      This is what you will be investigating in this lab.

    <h2>
      <b><i>Instructions</i></b>
    </h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pick one of these factors to test in your experiment:<br>
            <b>Number of wire coils</b><br>
            <b>Length of nail</b> <i>(use multiple nails of varying lengths; be sure to record their lengths!)</i><br>
            <b>Length of wire</b> <i>(use multiple lengths of wire; the minimum length should be 5 inches!)</i><br>
            <b>You will examine how your chosen factor effects paper clip pickups.</b>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Formulate an experiment, including your <b>variables (dependent and independent)</b> and <b>constants</b>, <b>how you will gather data</b>, and <b>how you will analyze the data</b>.<br>
            You will need to include <u>specific details</u> about your experiment.<br>
            You will be attempting to answer the question of if increasing your chosen independent variable (see step 1) causes more paper clips to be picked up.<br>
            Then, <b>get approval on this experiment from your teacher.</b>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Conduct your experiment, gather your data, and analyze it as you planned in the previous step.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finally, create a poster to report your findings in the format shown below:
