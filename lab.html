      <b>Electricity</b> and <b>magnetism</b> are related forces.<br>
      Wires that carry a <i>current</i> create <b>magnetic fields</b>.<br>
      This <b>magnetic field</b> can be strengthened by coiling a wire into a <b>solenoid</b>.<br>
      It can be further strengthened by inserting a <b>metal core</b> into the <b>solenoid</b>, such as a nail.<br>
      Increasing the <i>current</i> of the wire will also strengthen the <b>magnetic field</b> accordingly.<br>
      <b>This structure is known as an <i>electromagnet</i>.</b><br>
      It is a <i>powerful tool</i> because it <b>behaves like a magnet when electrified, but otherwise, it has no magnetic properties.</b><br>
      This <u>lab</u> will help you learn all about <b>electromagnetism</b> and <i>how it works</i>.
