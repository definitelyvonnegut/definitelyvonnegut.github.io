    <h3>
      A <b>circuit</b> is <u>any path through which electrons can flow.</u><br>
      <b>Circuits are very useful for a multitude of purposes.</b><br>
      These are the basic parts of a circuit:
    </h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <b>power source</b>: This provides electrons to power the circuit.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <b>wire</b>: This allows the electrons from the <i>power source</i> to flow, creating a <u>current</u>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <b>resistor</b>: This resists the flow of electrons. Anything which the circuit provides power to (such as a lightbulb) is a <i>resistor</i>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>
      <b><i>Circuit Diagrams</i></b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to build a circuit, you must be able to read a <b>diagram</b>. This is an example of a circuit diagram:
    </p>
    <div class="imgholder">
      <img src="circuitdiagram.png" alt="A very basic series circuit diagram.">
    </div>
    <p>
      On this diagram, the pair of lines on the left represents the <i>power source</i>.<br>
      The straight lines coming from the <i>power source</i> and forming a rectangle represent the <i>wires</i>.<br>
      The <b>/\/\/\/\/\/\/</b> diagonal lines represent <i>resistors</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this diagram to build a circuit <i>(with lights as resistors)</i> yields a circuit looking something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="imgholder">
      <img src="circuitimg.jpg" alt="The diagrammed circuit.">
    </div>
    <p>
      This is a basic <b>series circuit</b>. They are simple circuits with one path for current. If one <i>resistor</i> breaks, nothing is able to work.<br>
      <b>Parallel circuits</b> are the other, more complex type of circuit. They differ in having multiple branches, and thus they are still able to function when a <i>resistor</i> goes out.
    </p>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Handle the ends of an uninsulated wire with <b><i><u>care</u></i></b>. Use erasers or other insulated materials and indirectly touch the ends.<br>
            <i>(Note: this is not as big of a problem with insulated wire, but being careful with the wire's ends is <b>very</b> important.</i>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The wire can get <i>very</i> hot.

      Part 1 of 2: <b><i>Series Circuit</i></b>

      <i>(for this circuit, use 3 of the 4 copper wire segments.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The diagram:</b>
    </p>
    <div class="imgholder">
      <img src="circuitdiagram2.PNG" alt="Another circuit diagram.">
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Procedure:</b>
    </p>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <i>Carefully</i> place one wire segment near each terminal of the battery.<br>
            <b>Don't connect them yet.</b>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Attach the other ends of these wires to each light.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Attach the remaining wire to the lights so that they are connected together.<br>
            By this point, all parts of the circuit except for the power source are in place.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <i>Now</i>, touch the ends of the wires to the terminals of the battery. The lights should illuminate.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>
      Now, try doing this:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Disconnect one of the lights from the circuit, or replace it with something nonconductive. Note that all of the others turn off.<br>
      If any of the lights were to break, this would also stop the flow of the rest of the circuit.<br>
      This is a <u>disadvantage</u> of series circuits. However, they are much simpler and easier to fix than the other type of circuit: <b>parallel.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(also, <b>note that one bulb is dimmer than the other, even if it is only slightly dimmer.</b> this is because voltage drops across series circuits.)</i>
    </p>
    <h3>
      Part 2 of 2: <b><i>Parallel Circuit</i></b>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>(for this circuit, use all 4 copper wire segments.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The diagram:</b>
    </p>
    <div class="imgholder">
      <img src="circuitdiagram3.PNG" alt="Yet another circuit diagram.">
    </div>
    <p>
      <i>(as you can see, this circuit is a little more complex than the simple series circuit above.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Procedure:</b>
    </p>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Place the ends of two of the wires near the battery, but don't connect them yet, as in step 1 of the series circuit procedure above.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Connect the ends of these two wires to one of the lightbulbs. <i>(if you were to give the circuit power at this point, it would be a working series circuit.</i>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now, using the two remaining wires, connect this lightbulb to another lightbulb. <b>This grants the electricity more than one path to follow, which is what makes this circuit parallel.</b>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finally, connect the wires <b><i>safely</i></b> to the battery, and both lights should power on. <b>Note that their brightness is equal, contrary to when the bulbs were connected in series.</b>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>
      Now, try doing this:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Disconnect one of the lights from the circuit like you did with the series circuit and keep the other one connected.<br>
      <b>Notice how the other light doesn't go out.</b> This is because, in a parallel circuit, if one current path cannot be used, there is still another one available for the electrons to flow through.<br>
      This is an <i>advantage</i> of a parallel circuit over a series circuit, and it is also used in house wiring plans, because different room power outlets can be turned on or off without affecting the rest of the building.<br>
      Parallel circuits <i>do</i> have a disadvantage in that they are more complex than series circuits and thus more difficult to repair and service.
